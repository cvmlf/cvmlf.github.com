Each tournament calculates points as follows: 
(# of competitors / 2.718281828) + 4
minus your place finished in the tournament
plus (1.5 for 1st, 1.0 for 2nd, 0.5 for third) + 1.0 for big bass. 
You are guaranteed at least 1.0 point for showing up to a tournament and 2.0 points if you catch at least one scorable fish. 
Each competitor was able to drop their lowest two tournaments of the year.
