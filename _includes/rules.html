                    A cell phone is required for each competitor.
                    We have a text messaging system to track fish and to give 
                    leaderboard updates throughout the tournament.
                  </li>
                  <li>Every fish must be weighed and submitted to the score tracker immediately using a digital scale.</li>
                  <li>Your score will be the total weight of all fish submitted to score tracker (no limit).</li>
                  <li>Largemouth and smallmouth bass are the target fish. 
                    A scoreable bass needs to weigh at least 1 pound. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    No nets. All fish must be landed by hand.
                  </li>
                  <li>No Wake
                    <br/> 
                      Bring any type of boat from kayaks to bass boats but if you 
                      have a gas engine you can only use it at no wake speeds. 
                      This keeps things more even for those in kayaks or canoes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Artificial lures only.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There will be 2 periods with a lunch break between period 1 and 2.Â 
                  </li>                  
                  <li>
                    Competitors are allowed 15 minutes to explore the lake before
                    each period begins. No fishing is allowed until the period starts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A fish must be landed before the end of the period in order to score.
                    There will be a 2 minute grace period after "lines out" where a bass can still be entered.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Competitors may not fish the tournament lake the week before the tournament.
