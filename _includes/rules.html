                Here are the tournament rules and specifics about the MLF format:
                <ol>
                  <li> 
                    A cell phone is required ðŸ“±. 
                    We have a text messaging system that will be used to score fish and to get 
                    leaderboard updates throughout the tournament.
                  </li>
                  <li>Every fish must be weighed on a digital scale</li>
                  <li>Largemouth and smallmouth bass are the target fish. 
                    A scoreable bass needs to weight at least 1 pound. 
                    Fish will be immediately released after weighed and entered into the system. 
                  </li>
                  <li>No Wake 
                      Bring any type of boat from kayaks to bass boats but if you 
                      have a gas engine you can only use it at no wake speeds. 
                      This keeps things more even for those in kayaks or canoes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There will be 2 periods with a lunch/hang out time in between.Â 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    No nets. All fish must be landed by hand.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Artificial lures only.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Competitors are allowed 15 minutes to explore the lake before
                    each period begins. No fishing is allowed until the period starts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A fish must be landed before the end of the period in order to score.
                    This amounts to a 2 minute grace period where text messages are
                    still received after "lines out".
                  </li>
                  <li>
                                       
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  
                  </li>
                </ol>
