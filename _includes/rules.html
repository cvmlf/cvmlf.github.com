                    A cell phone is required for each competitor. Competitors may share a cell phone number when in the same boat.
                    Score tracker updates will be delivered in real time throughout the tournament.
                  </li>
                  <li>Every fish must be weighed and submitted to the score tracker immediately using a digital scale.</li>
                  <li>Your score will be the total weight of all fish submitted to score tracker (no limit).</li>
                  <li>Largemouth and smallmouth bass are the target fish. 
                    A scoreable bass needs to weigh at least 1 pound.

                    Nets are allowed when landing fish.

                    <br/> 
                      Bring any type of boat from kayaks to bass boats but if you 
                      have a gas engine you can only use it at no wake speeds. 
                      This keeps things more even for those in kayaks or canoes.

                    There will be 2 periods with a lunch break between period 1 and 2.Â

                  <li>
                    Competitors are allowed 15 minutes to explore the lake before
                    each period begins. No fishing is allowed until the period starts.

                  <li>
                    A fish must be landed before the end of the period in order to score.
                    There will be a 2 minute grace period after "lines out" where a bass can still be entered.

                    Competitors may not fish the tournament lake the week before the tournament.

                    Competitors are allowed to leave their boats to fish from shore when desired and where appropriate.

                    The last tournament of the year is the CVMLF Championship. Club members need to qualify for this event in one of the following ways:
                      <ol>
                        <li>
                          The top finisher (who has not already qualified) from each of the five tournaments 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          The top three anglers (who have not already qualified) in the point standings after five tournaments. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Any angler who has fished in all five regular season tournaments will automatically qualify.
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The championship is different than a regular season tournament in the following ways: 
                      <ol>
                        <li>Period 1 is an elimination round where half of the anglers will be eliminated</li>
                        <li>The elimination round will have a target weight, where once an angler reaches the target weight they automatically advance to the championship round.</li>
                        <li>Period 2 is the championship round and begins with all weights set to zero</li>
                      </ol>
                    </li>
                  </ul>  
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Awards will be given out to the top three finishers in the championship as well as the big bass of the tournament.
